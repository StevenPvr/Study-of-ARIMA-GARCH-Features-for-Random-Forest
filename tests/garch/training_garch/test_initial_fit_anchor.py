"""Tests for initial fit anchoring in EGARCHForecaster.

These tests ensure that, even when the forecaster is configured with a
rolling window for refits, the expanding forecast on TRAIN anchors the
initial fit and scheduling start at ``initial_window_size`` (not the
rolling ``window_size``). This matches the training setup and avoids
instability when early windows are too short or unrepresentative.
